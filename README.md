# # My Independent Week Project
#   My first website
# Author:John Mburu Nkonge

This repository contains some of the many consepts and content that Ive learned for the past one week.
I was recently introduced to a few programming languages which are HTML and CSS.
Since it is my first time and I had no equipped skills in coding, it has been a heavy week.
Im trying and learning new skills to incoporate to my newly taught skills and I hope i will be better.
For now, its safe to say that Moringa school has helped me a lot.
